# Efficient and Robust Neural Combinatorial Optimization via Wasserstein-Based Coresets

This repository contains implementations and explanations for using coreset methods to accelerate neural combinatorial optimization algorithms.

## Folder Structure

- `my_nips24_tsp/`: Contains code for solving the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) using the coreset methods
  - `tsp_README.md`: Detailed instructions and explanations for the TSP implementation.
  
- `my_nips24_mis/`: Contains code for solving the Minimum Independent Set (MIS) problem using the coreset methods
  - `mis_README.md`: Detailed instructions and explanations for the MIS implementation.

- `my_nips24_cvrp`: Contains code for solving the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP) using the coreset methods
  - `cvrp_README.md`: Detailed instructions and explanations for the CVRP implementation.

## Usage

Each folder (`tsp`, `MIS`, `CVRP`) contains its respective implementation along with a detailed `**_README.md`  file explaining its usage, dependencies, and how to run the code.
